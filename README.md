# Welcome to my [portfolio](https://vensah-dev.github.io)

This website is still under development.

## Landing page
When and if the site gets big enough there will be a landing page with the latest years about and latest or best projects and some competencies on display. Will only make this page if the website is large enough or if it feels necessary.

## About Page ✅
This will be the landing page for now and the aim is to let vistors get a crash course on who am I and my skills and programming journey through a scrollable timeline and some image cards and possibly some of my projects

## Projects Page ✅
The aim is to have a full archive of all my projects, however most of them will have to be accessed by searching. My latest and greatest projects will be featured in depth in this page and some possibly in the about page

## Testimonials Page
Possibly make a page just for the testimonials, would be too specific toward DSA, not confirmed just an idea.

## Competencies Page
The aim is to have a skill tree or something similar, a visual and interactive way of exploring my skills and values

## Achievements Page ➖
Super similar to the Projects Page but for all of my awards and certificates, so idk for sure if I will make this page.
