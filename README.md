# Welcome to my portfolio 
This website is still under development.

## About Page
This will be the landing page for now and the aim is to let vistors get a crash course on who am I and my skills and programming journey through a scrollable timeline and some image cards and possibly some of my projects

## Competencies Page
The aim is to have a skill tree or something similar, a visual and interactive way of exploring my skills and values

## Projects Page
The aim is to have a full archive of all my projects, however most of them will have to be accessed by searching. My latest and greatest projects will be featured in depth in this page and some possibly in the about page

## Achievements Page
Super similar to the Projects Page but for all of my awards and certificates, so idk for sure if I will make this page.
