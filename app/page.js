          After a year of Scratch, PSLE and overcoming the reluctance to learn a syntax based language I 
          started making games in the Unity. This required learning OOP and C# as my very first syntax based language. 
          In 2 weeks I got a hang of Unity 3D and C# MonoBehaviour by creating an Infinite 3D Procedural Terrain Generation 
          system using layered Perlin Noise and custom mesh generation.
